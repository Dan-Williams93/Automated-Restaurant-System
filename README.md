# Automated-Restaurant-System
An automated system bringing dining out into a new era.

The Automated Restaurant System consists (currently) of three individual applications that bring the experience of dining into a new era. The aim of this project is to dvelop an open source alternative to high cost systems that are currently used in a select few businesses around the world. 

This development aims to enable customers to interact with a mobile device to 1: Select their table, 2: Order food and 3: Pay their bill taking the strain of members of staff and creating an easier and calmer experience for diners. 

Currently three individual systems have been implemented with the use of an internal MySQL database:
1: The first system simply displayes a floor layout or the given restaurant and indicated which tables are currently available to the user. The user is then able to select their desired table.

2: The second system is designed to be on a table top device allowing customer to view and select items from the restaurants menu. This system also allows the user to complete a financial transaction for their order and watch the progression of the order untill it reahes their table.

3: The third system is for use within the restaurant kitchen. This system continuously looks for new orders and displayes cirrently active orders. The system allows kithchen staff to change the status of the order.
